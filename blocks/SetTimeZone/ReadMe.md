####For Harun: It needs to run as Custom script extensions -To be run on all VMs.     

#should be run from administrative powershell

#What the script accomplishes:      
-This powershell script sets time zone of the windows computer to UTC.

-It also sets/increases default log size to 64000 KB from 20480 KB.
    
Testing instructions:       
1)Log into each vm where extension is installed.        
2)Once logged in, from the bottom right of the vm screen- check if time zone is "UTC"
